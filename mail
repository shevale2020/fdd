Hi Rizwan,

Have you and Swati started exploring the GAMS Source code? I understand from Amit that Mumbai team is mostly working on Database scripts and are doing minimal/no changes web application source code.

I need estimates for “Enhancements - IT” category so that plan can be put in place. Raise any questions to Romit & Shubhadeep if requirements are not clear. 

I want us to commence development from 12-Nov with first sprint completing on 30-Nov.
